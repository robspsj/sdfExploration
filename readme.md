### Project Goals
in this project I wnat to explore a a few techniques to draw smooth curves and shapes from vector graphics in zwero limited texture format like sdf with a final goal of creating a way to create an assset exporter that can be used in engines like unity or godot. I'll try documenting in a journal like fashion.

as initial decisions i want to use:
- **cpp** as the main programming language,
- **opengl** as a rendering backend, 
- **imgui** for gui library,
- **git** for version controll,
- **visual studio** for solution management.

That is a mix of subjects that I feel confortable in and subjects that I want to improve.

### today goals
my goal for the first session is to be able to compile a base application for imgui and show a dynamicly create texture inside a window, that is something that i was able to acomplish before, but in an unstructured way, today i want to experiment with structuring my code in a maintanable form
